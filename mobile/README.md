This is the ASUS Beard mobile app.

To run, first install React Native for Android:
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

Then execute `react-native run-android`.

Live code reloading can be enabled using the Dev Menu, which is
accessible by typing cmd+m on an emulator or shaking a real device.

The app is a home screen app that does a whole bunch of nasty
hacks to make sure it's the only thing running. Don't install
it on a phone that you want to use for something else.
